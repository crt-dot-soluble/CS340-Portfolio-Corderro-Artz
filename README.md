## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I focus on using clear names, consistent formatting, and modular design. In my CRUD Python module from Project One, I separated each database action into its own method, making the code reusable for Project Two’s dashboard. This approach minimized duplication and made updates easy. In the future, I could reuse this CRUD module in other database-driven projects, adjusting only connection details as needed.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I break problems into smaller, manageable parts. For Grazioso Salvare, I first focused on database connection, then on retrieving and preparing data, and finally on building the dashboard’s layout and interactive features. Compared to earlier assignments, this project required working across both backend and frontend layers. Going forward, I would continue gathering client needs early and designing database models that directly support their workflows.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve problems by organizing information and building systems that make data useful. My dashboard project helps Grazioso Salvare identify and train rescue dogs faster and more efficiently. Work like this matters because it transforms raw data into decisions and real-world actions, supporting critical missions like search-and-rescue efforts.
